# proconsebi-netlify

This app was developed when I've started learning Angular 2+. The process of developing this spa application helped me understand the core concepts of working with a leading front-end framework. I have also learned the basics of typescript in this process. Besides that, it demonstrates some well known front-end skills like: html5, css, bootstrap and font awesome, despite the fact that my professional experience is focused on back-end development (.NET).
